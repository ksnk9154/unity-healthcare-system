# Dashboard Appointment Filtering Fix

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Analyze the current appointment filtering issue
- [x] Identify that date and time are separate fields in the database
- [x] Understand that current logic only uses date part, ignoring time
- [x] Fix the filtering logic in Dashboard.jsx to properly combine date and time
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure proper categorization

## Current Issue:
Appointments are not being properly divided into "Upcoming" and "Past" sections because the filtering logic only considers the date part and ignores the time component.

## Solution:
Fixed by combining the `apt.date` and `apt.time` fields to create proper datetime objects for accurate comparison using: `new Date(`${apt.date}T${apt.time}`)`

## Changes Made:
- Updated `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` to properly handle both date and time in appointment filtering
- Replaced `const aptDate = new Date(apt.date);` with `const aptDateTime = new Date(`${apt.date}T${apt.time}`);`
- Updated the comparison logic to use the combined datetime object
